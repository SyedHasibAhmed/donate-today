            <p>At least 62 people have died and millions of homes were left underwater after floods hit north-eastern in
                Bangladesh. Bangladesh have asked the military to help with the extreme deluge, which officials fear
                could intensify with further rain forecasted for the weekend.

                At least 15 people have been struck dead by lightning in Bangladesh since Friday, and four people were
                killed in landslides, police officials said.</p>
